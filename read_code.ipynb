What resources do we have—or can we create—for reimagining “the human” and the more-than-human in ways that might be emancipatory for both? What kinds of cultural efforts, artistic work, social practices, and political institutions might figure in this reimagining? This collaborative humanities seminar explores a diverse range of contemporary and historical works ranging from poetry, fiction, and film to theology, social and political theory, nature writing, and environmental studies, including work by Wordsworth, Shelley, Bennett, Vogel, Du Bois, Gomez-Baris, Jarman, and Nixon, among others. The course emphasizes collaborative thinking and writing, both inside and outside the classroom.   Course Requirements (1) Regular attendance.  If you cannot attend a seminar, let us know in advance.  Read the assignments carefully and be prepared to say something about them during our conversations together.  Throughout the semester, we will endeavor to make connections between past and present sessions.    (2) Collaboratively hosting a class session: Groups of 2-3 students will host approximately the first half of one class session (written notes that reflect the dynamic, collaborative preparation for the session will be circulated in advance). Members of the hosting team are not expected to become experts for the sessions lead; they are expected to be informed readers and thoughtful hosts (educators) for our conversations.   (3) Final paper: A final paper of 20-25 pages due on May 13.    (4) Collaboratively edited volume: The final paper will be part of a larger, edited volume of 3 to 5 papers, conceived collaboratively by small groups of students and with a collaboratively written Introduction. Later in the seminar we will discuss the logistics for this edited volume. For now you should know that, based on shared interests, you will form groups of 3 to 5 and you will collaboratively develop a topic/focus for an edited book or journal that will include your final papers and you will co-author an Introduction to the volume.    (5) Retreat: Participation in the course retreat at the end of the term, including a presentation of your  ideas for the final paper and collaboratively edited volume.   Institutional Grade Evaluation Your letter grade will normally be calculated as follows:  Class participation, including hosting sessions: 25%  Collaboratively edited volume (its topic and introduction): 20%  Presentation at the retreat: 10%  Final Paper: 45% \n",

      " Time Requirements and Other Useful Material  Time Requirements: Students can expect to spend 2.5 hours per week in class, 10 hours per week doing course reading and other out-of-class work; and an additional 40 hours in researching and writing the term paper for a total of 190 hours.  Learning Goals:  To achieve a high level of engagement in the intersecting fields of democratic theory and environmental ethics. To refine such analytic skills as interpreting texts and making nuanced distinctions; critiquing detailed arguments; formulating complex positions on issues pertaining to political theory, environmental studies, and normative inquiry.   Learning Accommodations: Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students. Please inform us early in the term if you may require accommodations or modification of any of course procedures. You may speak with us after class, during office hours, or by appointment. If you need accommodations around online learning or in classroom accommodations, please be sure to reach out to Student Accessibility Services (SAS) for their assistance (seas@brown.edu, 401-863-9588). Undergraduates in need of short-term academic advice or support can contact an academic dean in the College by emailing college@brown.edu.  Writing Assistance: If you are struggling with your writing in any portion of the course, please talk to us. For additional help on your writing, consult the expert staff at the Brown Writing Center (https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/support/writing-center/)  Respect For Diversity: Our wish is that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is our intent to present material in a fashion that is respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the atmosphere and effectiveness of the course.  Preferred Names and Pronouns: Please advise us at the beginning of the semester what you wish to be called and what pronouns you prefer.   Academic Conduct: Please read Brown University’s policies on academic conduct carefully (http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Dean_of_the_College/curriculum/documents/principles.pdf). Handing in someone else’s work or ideas as your own (even if you worked on it together as a group) constitutes plagiarism, as does using someone’s ideas without appropriate citations, including AI-generated text.  \n",
